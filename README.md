# Multiclass Classification on Digits Dataset

![Digits](https://img.shields.io/badge/Digits-Multiclass%20Classification-blue)

This repository performs a multiclass classification task using scikit-learn on the Digits dataset. The Digits dataset contains grayscale images of hand-written digits (0 to 9), and the goal is to build and evaluate different machine learning models to accurately predict the digit labels based on the image data.

## Dataset - Digits

The [Digits dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html#digits-dataset) is a classic multiclass classification dataset containing grayscale images of hand-written digits (0 to 9). Each sample is an 8x8 image, and there are 10 classes.

## Algorithms Compared

The following multiclass classification algorithms are compared in this project:

- Logistic Regression
- k-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
- Multi-Layer Perceptron (Neural Network)

## Evaluation Metrics

To assess the performance of each algorithm, the following evaluation metrics are used:

- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report (including precision, recall, and F1-score for each class)

## Project Structure

```
- multiclass_classification_digits.ipynb  # Jupyter Notebook with the code
- README.md                              # This README file
```

## Getting Started

To run the multiclass classification and evaluate the models, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/multiclass-classification-digits.git
```

2. Install the required packages (if not already installed) by running:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn matplotlib
```

3. Open the `Digits_Classification_Algorithms.ipynb` notebook and execute the code cells.

4. The notebook will train and evaluate various classifiers using the Digits dataset, and the evaluation results will be displayed.

## Results

The evaluation results, including accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report, will be presented for each algorithm. The models' performance on classifying the hand-written digits will be showcased.
